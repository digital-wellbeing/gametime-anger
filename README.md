# dwg-bookdown-template

This is the digital well-being group's bookdown [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) for data analysis projects that intend to present results as a bookdown website.

This template makes it easier to start a project that will result in an output document that looks like our longitudinal game time study, without having to start a bookdown locally and edit themes etc.

## What's in it

- An RStudio bookdown project
  - custom theming like [here](https://digital-wellbeing.github.io/gametime-longitudinal/) in `_bookdown.yml`, `_common.R`, `_output.yml`, and `style.css`

## How to use it

Click the [green button](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) [here](https://github.com/digital-wellbeing/dwg-bookdown-template).

Start a reasonable `README.md` by copying from `index.Rmd`.
